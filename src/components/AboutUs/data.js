      <p>
        Civil Conclave 2021 provides a common platform for civil engineering
        enthusiasts.Being an inter-IIT event, it aims at bringing together the
        students from the most elite colleges of India to compete and network.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Young minds when put in the right direction can excel in all
        fields. Civil engineering being the prime need of all times, rigorously
        needs the budding minds for overall growth.<br></br>
        <br></br>We understand this idea and are out to promote the same on the
        inter-IIT level.
