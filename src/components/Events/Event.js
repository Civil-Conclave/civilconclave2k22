            The Case Study focuses on enhancing the help they need to build the
            skills necessary to develop and to launch innovative approaches to
            address the industry challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through this event, we aim to give Teams working collaboratively to
            understand the role of research and ideation in solving real-life
            scenarios. We focus on providing unique points of view and context
            for understanding global problems and developing solutions at scale
            while gaining real-world experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, we also recognise the significance of learning that occurs
            outside of the formal classroom setting â€” learning that occurs
            within their cohort via institutional networks and through
            co-curricular experiences on the broader level.
